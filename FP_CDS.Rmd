## 1. Introduction {.tabset}

### Motivation:
Why is this dataset interesting for you? What makes it suitable for multivariate analysis


### Research Question: 
What are you trying to uncover in the data? If you follow a guiding question, state it here. Guiding Questions for Analysis

Risk Patterns & Market Conditions
How do CDS spreads behave in calm vs. crisis periods (e.g., during COVID-19)?
Are some industries or companies consistently seen as high-risk?
Multivariate Relationships & Dependencies
How do CDS spreads for different maturities (short-term vs. long-term) move together for the same company?
Can we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to find key risk factors driving CDS spreads?
Clustering & Risk Groups
Can we identify clusters of companies that have similar risk trends? (e.g., using hierarchical clustering or k-means)
Do companies within the same industry tend to have similar CDS spread behavior?
Advanced Dependency Analysis
How do time-varying dependencies between companies evolve? (e.g., using copulas to measure joint risk behavior)
Can we model the spillover effectâ€”how risk changes in one company affect others?
